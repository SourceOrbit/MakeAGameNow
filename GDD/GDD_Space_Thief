High Concept
A 3rd person object dodging game using two buttons where you avoid obstacles that fly at you from a forward
direction in 3 dimensions!

Story:
Orbit Captain


Controls:
The game is controlled by pressing two buttons (Or pressing the left or right side of the screen on mobile platforms).
The left button makes the player character move laterally to the left, and the right button makes them move laterally
to the right.

Obstacles:
For now while learning, Cubes. Spheres. Pyramids. Cones.
When I get better Enemies. Stars. Meteors.

Level Variations:
Inside of a tube?

GUI menus:
Main menu Play. HighScore. Options. Exit

Weapons?


Notes:
I'd like to get some 2d elements in this game as well as the 3d. Maybe the main character can be
a sprite.
